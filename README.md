>## Concepts 🔧
### Values of The Agile Manifesto
1. Individuals and Interactions Over Processes and Tools
2. Working Software Over Comprehensive Documentation
3. Customer Collaboration Over Contract Negotiation
4. Responding to Change Over Following a Plan

### Scrum Team
`Must not be more than 10 people` ❌

`Everyone have their own accountability` ✅

`There's no hierarchy` 🆙

```python
class Team:
    def __init__(Role1): 🎯
        role1.name = "Product Owner" 
        role1.task = "What to build?"
        role1.supports = "Understanding client's needs"
    def __init__(Role2): ⏰
        role2.name = "Scrum Master" 
        role2.task = "Delivers on time"
        role2.supports = "Continuous improvement"
    def __init__(Role3): 🏭
        role3.name = "Developer" 
        role3.task = "How to build it?"
        role3.supports = "Team multi-functional and auto-managed"
```
